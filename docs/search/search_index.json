Simple Proxy allows you to run TCP proxy capable of routing the connection based on HTTP Host header or SNI hostname in TLS connection. Install \u00b6 Pre-built binaries are available from releases page. You can also install simple-proxy using go get . Using go get : go get -u github.com/Gufran/simple-proxy Configuration \u00b6 Proxy configuration is written in HCL. Following parameters are supported in the configuration file: listen ( block ): Configures a local listener. listen takes one label which must be a properly formatted listener address in host:port or :port format. Multiple listen blocks can be used to configure multiple listeners. Following attributes are supported inside listen block. proxy_to : Destination address for proxy route : Routing configuration for the proxy. Example # Listen on port 8765 on loopback interface listen \"127.0.0.1:8765\" { // ... } # Listen on port 8765 on all interfaces listen \":8765\" { // ... } # Same port can be used multiple times listen \":8765\" { // ... } proxy_to ( string , optional ): proxy_to is supported at root level of listener block and configures a direct proxy to destination. Value of proxy_to must adhere to host:port format. Example listen \":8765\" { proxy_to = \"my-domain.com:7654\" } route ( block , optional ): route block configures a routing decision. Multiple route blocks can be specified on a listener to configure multiple routes. Following attributes are supported inside route block: host : Host header to match for HTTP/1 request routing sni : SNI header to match for TLS connection routing to : Proxy destination address. Must be in host:port format Example listen \":8765\" { route { host = \"my-domain.com\" to = \"other-domain.com\" } route { sni = \"secure-domain.com\" to = \"other-secure-domain.com\" } route { host = \"my-domain.com\" sni = \"other-domain.com\" to = \"same-domain.com\" } } Note Only one of proxy_to or route can be specified, not both. At least one of the attributes must be configured on each listener.","title":"Simple Proxy"},{"location":"#simple-proxy","text":"Simple Proxy is exactly what it says in title - Simple Proxy.
